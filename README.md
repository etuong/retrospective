# Retrospective 🪂

A retrospective is an opportunity for your team to reflect on the past to improve the future.

During the Sprint Retrospective, the team discusses:

- What went well in the Sprint
- What could be improved
- Identify action items to improve in the next Sprint

There are many retrospective apps out there but many are hard to use. I aim to create a simple and straightforward prototype that provides a seamless experience for everybody!

# Get your app running! 🛵

Use the following commands to start the development server:

```
cd retrospective
npm install
npm run dev
```

# Remake 👩‍💻

Wireframes are for structure. Mockups are for visuals. Prototypes are for usability.

This project is bootstrapped with Remake. Often time, I like to make prototypes to demonstrate an idea but this could take a lot of time.

With [Remake](https://docs.remaketheweb.com/getting-started/), we can create a fully-functioning web app by adding a few custom attributes to our HTML & CSS. Remake skips the hard parts and gives us a small layer of data on top of our HTML that's automatically synced with each user's data. It makes creating scalable multi-page web apps with unique data for each user incredibly easy.
