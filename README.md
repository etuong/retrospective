# Remake 👩‍💻👨

Wireframes are for structure. Mockups are for visuals. Prototypes are for usability.

This project is bootstrapped with Remake. Often time, I like to make prototypes to demonstrate an idea but this could take a lot of time.

With [Remake](https://docs.remaketheweb.com/getting-started/), we can create a fully-functioning web app by adding a few custom attributes to our HTML & CSS. Remake skips the hard parts and gives us a small layer of data on top of our HTML that's automatically synced with each user's data. It makes creating scalable multi-page web apps with unique data for each user incredibly easy.
